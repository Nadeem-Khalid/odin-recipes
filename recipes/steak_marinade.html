    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      Marinating a steak before cooking serves two purposes: It helps tenderize
      the meat and adds just the right amount of flavor. Some top-quality steaks
      can go without a marinade, since they're already full of meaty flavor and,
      with the right prep, end up juicy and tender without any help from a
      marinade. Budget-friendly steaks, however, benefit tremendously from
      marination. You'll be shocked at the difference a good marinade makes!
